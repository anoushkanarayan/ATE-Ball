# ATEBall

This repository contains the code for the 2024-2025 USC Makers project, ATE Ball. The goal of this project is to detect the positions of each ball on a pool table and generate trajectory lines that replicate Apple's GamePigeon 8-Ball. The code runs on our modified pool table, bringing the digital GamePigeon 8-Ball experience into real-life gameplay.
